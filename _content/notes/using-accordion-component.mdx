The Accordion component is a great way to organize content in an expandable/collapsible format. Here's how you can use it in your MDX content.

## Basic Example

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem value="item-1">
    <AccordionTrigger>What is an Accordion?</AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>
      An accordion is a vertically stacked set of interactive headings that each reveal a section of
      content. It's perfect for FAQs, product details, or any content that benefits from progressive
      disclosure.
    </AccordionContent>
  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>

## Multiple Items Example

<Accordion multiple>
  <AccordionItem value="item-1">
    <AccordionTrigger>Is it accessible?</AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>
      Yes. It adheres to the WAI-ARIA design pattern and uses proper ARIA attributes
      for screen readers. The component is also fully keyboard navigable.
    </AccordionContent>
  </AccordionItem>

<AccordionItem value="item-2">
  <AccordionTrigger>Can it be styled?</AccordionTrigger>
  <AccordionContent>
    Absolutely! The accordion component is built with Tailwind CSS and can be easily customized to
    match your design system. You can modify colors, spacing, animations, and more.
  </AccordionContent>
</AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem value="item-3">
    <AccordionTrigger>Is it animated?</AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>
      Yes, the accordion includes smooth animations when expanding and collapsing content.
      These animations are built using CSS transitions and can be customized or disabled
      if needed.
    </AccordionContent>
  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>

## Usage Tips

1. Use accordions when you have a lot of related content that can be broken down into sections
2. Keep the trigger text (headers) concise and descriptive
3. Ensure the content within each section is relevant to its header
4. By default, only one section can be open at a time (single mode)
5. Use the `multiple` prop when users might need to compare information across sections

The accordion component is particularly useful for:

- FAQs
- Product specifications
- Step-by-step guides
- Terms and conditions
- Navigation menus on mobile devices
