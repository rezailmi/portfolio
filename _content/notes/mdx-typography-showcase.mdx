This post demonstrates all the available typography elements and MDX components you can use in your blog posts.

## Basic Typography

### Paragraphs and Text Styling

Regular paragraph text looks like this. You can write normally and include **bold text**, _italic text_, or **_bold and italic text_**. You can also use ~strikethrough~ when needed.

You can also write `inline code` using backticks, which is great for technical terms.

### Links and References

You can create [inline links](https://example.com) or reference-style links like this: [my portfolio][1].

[1]: https://example.com

### Lists

Unordered list:

- First item
- Second item
  - Nested item
  - Another nested item
- Third item
- Fourth item
- Fifth item

Ordered list:

1. First step
2. Second step
   1. Sub-step one
   2. Sub-step two
3. Third step

Task list:

- [x] Completed task
- [ ] Pending task
- [ ] Future task

### Blockquotes

}
```
