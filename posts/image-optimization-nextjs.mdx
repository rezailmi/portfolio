# Image Optimization with Next.js

When building modern web applications, image optimization is crucial for performance. Next.js provides an excellent Image component that handles this automatically.

## Basic Examples

Here's how to use images with different optimization settings:

### 1. Fixed Width Image

### 2. Responsive Image with Priority Loading

### 3. Full Width Image

## How to Control Image Settings

You can control various image settings in MDX using these methods:

1. **Fixed Dimensions**:
   ```md
   ![Alt text](image.jpg "width=400 height=300")
   ```

2. **Responsive Classes with Tailwind**:
   ```md
   ![Alt text](image.jpg "className='w-full md:w-2/3 lg:w-1/2'")
   ```

3. **Priority Loading** (for above-the-fold images):
   ```md
   ![Alt text](image.jpg "width=800 height=400 priority=true")
   ```

## Benefits of Next.js Image Component

1. **Automatic Optimization**: 
   - Images are automatically optimized and converted to modern formats (WebP/AVIF)
   - Quality setting of 85 provides good balance between quality and file size
   - External images are handled appropriately with unoptimized flag

2. **Smart Loading**:
   - Images use native lazy loading by default
   - Priority loading available for above-the-fold images
   - Prevents Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)

3. **Responsive Images**:
   - Automatically serves the right size for each device
   - Supports responsive sizing through Tailwind classes
   - Uses appropriate `sizes` attribute for optimal loading

4. **Best Practices**:
   - Always includes `alt` text for accessibility
   - Proper aspect ratio maintained
   - Prevents layout shift with consistent spacing
   - Handles both local and external images appropriately
